**Question: The Mystical Library Manager**

Imagine you are tasked with creating a digital library for a mystical academy, where ancient scrolls and tomes 
containing powerful spells and incantations need to be managed with utmost care and efficiency. You must use a 
combination of programming concepts to accomplish this. Each section builds upon the previous one.

**Part 1: Classes and Shared Pointers (10 points)**

Design a class hierarchy for the mystical documents. You should have a base class, `MysticalDocument`, 
and at least one derived class, say `Scroll` and `Tome`. Implement the following using shared pointers:

- Create a container to store multiple mystical documents using shared pointers.
- Overload the insertion (`<<`) operator to display the contents of the documents.
- Explain how shared pointers ensure proper memory management in this context.

**Part 2: Operator Overloading and Templates (15 points)**

Extend your design by overloading operators to perform meaningful operations on the mystical documents. 
Implement the following:

- Overload a comparison operator (`<`, `>`, or `==`) for `MysticalDocument` objects based on their mystical power levels.
- Use templates to create a container that can store documents of different types.
- Demonstrate the use of an STL algorithm (e.g., `std::sort`) to sort the documents based on their power levels.

**Part 3: Inheritance, Abstract Classes, and Dynamic Casting (15 points)**

Enhance your class hierarchy by incorporating inheritance and abstract classes. Consider the following:

- Make `MysticalDocument` an abstract base class with at least one pure virtual function.
- Add a derived class, such as `SpellScroll`, that implements the pure virtual function.
- Use dynamic casting to verify the type of a mystical document and call specialized methods only if the document is 
of the appropriate type.

**Part 4: Exceptions and File I/O (15 points)**

Implement exception handling and file I/O to ensure the integrity of the mystical documents. Do the following:

- Create a custom exception class, `MysticalLibraryException`, to handle errors related to document management.
- Implement functions to save and load mystical documents to and from files. Ensure that these operations do not 
compromise the mystical enchantments of the documents.

**Part 5: Design Patterns (10 points)**

Explain which design pattern(s) you would employ to manage the mystical documents effectively. 
Justify your choice(s) and provide a brief implementation or description of how the chosen pattern(s) would be applied.

Provide a complete code example that incorporates each of the sections above. 
Ensure that your code is well-commented to explain your implementation choices and that it builds upon the previous 
sections to create a comprehensive digital library for the mystical academy.
